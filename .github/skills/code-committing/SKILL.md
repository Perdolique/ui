# Code Committing

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Review the changes**: Carefully read the diff to understand what was modified
2. **Identify the type**: Determine the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
3. **Determine scope**: Identify the module or package name affected (for monorepo: use exact package name or `all`)
4. **Check for package updates**: Look for dependency version changes in package.json or similar files
5. **Write the summary**: Create a concise, imperative mood summary (≤50 characters)
6. **Add body bullets** (if needed): List additional details with emojis, each line ≤100 characters
7. **Add context** (optional): Include brief explanation of why the change was made, impact, or edge cases handled (keep it concise, this is a commit message not documentation)
8. **Include package updates**: Add a bullet for each updated package with version change
9. **Mark breaking changes** (if applicable): Add `!` to the type and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

## Commit Message Format

- **ALWAYS write commit messages in English only** - no other languages allowed
- Use semantic commit style (also known as conventional commits)
 Format: `<type>(<scope>): summary` or `<type>: summary` (≤50 chars, imperative)
- Body (optional): bullets `- {emoji} {text}` (≤100 chars/line) following after blank line
- Wrap package names, file names, or code snippets in backticks (`) for better readability

### Examples

```text
feat(button): add loading state

- ✨ Add spinner icon during async operations
- 📦 @ui/icons: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0
```

```text

- 🐛 Debounce focus handler to avoid duplicate calls
```

```text
feat(collapsible): add aria-expanded attribute

- ♿ Improve screen reader support for collapsed state

```

```text

- ✨ Replace RGB values with HSL format
- 💄 Update all component styles to use new tokens
- 📦 @ui/theme: v2.1.0 → v3.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Color token values changed from RGB to HSL format
```

## Types and Emojis

- feat ✨, fix 🐛, docs 📚, style 💄, refactor ♻️, perf ⚡, test ✅, build 🔧, ci 👷, chore 🔨, revert ⏪
- Breaking: add `!` and `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
- Scope: module or package name (monorepo: exact name or `all`)

## Issue Tracking

- When fixing issues, include them at the end of commit message body
- Format: - Fixes <ISSUE_NUMBER> (e.g., - Fixes #123 or - Fixes STL-1487)
- Add one bullet per issue
